# pug-element-loader

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/pug-element-loader.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/pug-element-loader)

A loader that converts pug mixin blocks into custom elements for web components.

### About

It provides the following conversion processes.

```
mixin sample-element(data-foo='default-value')
    h1(data-foo=)
```

### âš  Caution âš 

This is an experimental implementation and should not be used in a production environment.  
I accept no liability whatsoever.

### Usage

```shell
$ npm i pug-element-loader
```

It's not packaged yet, so if you want to try it out, clone this repository and use it.

For use with webpack.

The following is an example of `webpack.config.js`.

```javascript
module: {
    rules: [
        {
            test: /\.ce.pug$/,
            use: ["pug-element-loader"],
        },
    ]
}
```

The `***.ce.pug` file will then export a class object that inherits from HTMLElement, so all you have to do is define it as a custom element.

```pug
mixin sample-element(align)
    div.el-heading-lv2(style = `text-align: ${align};`)
        h2
            // block is the slot element.
            block
        p This is Sample.
```

All you have to do is register it as a custom element and write it in your HTML.

```javascript
import SampleElement from './sample-element.ce.pug';

// ex. <sample-element align="center">Sample Text</sample-element>
customElements.define('sample-element', SampleElement);
```

*1. Support for "Unescaped Attributes" and "Quoted Attributes" excluded.  
*2 "Block Comments" and "Conditional Comments" are excluded from support, but will be supported.  
*3 A simple pug file can probably be read, but is not fully validated.  
*4 Only "String Interpolation, Escaped" is supported, but other features will be supported.  
*5 Support will be promoted for use as multiple blocks, i.e. named slot elements.  
*6 "Inline in a Tag" and "Piped Text" are supported.  
*7 "Self-Closing Tags", i.e. void elements, cannot be controlled by JavaScript, so it seems impossible to implement.
